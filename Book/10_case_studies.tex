\section{Application case studies}
As we have seen in the `collaborative mixed reality' chapter, these tools are best deployed where some human conversational cues (pointing, looking etc) are required in the context of a shared task, which is mostly visual in nature. This is a surprisingly small amount of tasks, though we have seen that the emergence of AI means that increasingly natural language AI can streamline communication, while visual generative ML can suggest design alternatives or improvements based on existing data and user preferences. This is very likely to expand the use space and this section will attempt to explain how as the case studies are explained.\par 
We will employ the acronym for collaborative virtual environment (CVE) from this stage, and it's going to come up a lot. There will be far less references in this section for brevity.
\subsection{Classic use cases}
Small teams working on product, architectural, or industrial design can benefit from CVEs that allow them to visualize, modify, and iterate on 3D models in real-time. 
\subsection{Virtual training and simulation}
CVEs can facilitate skill development and training in various industries, such as healthcare, military, aviation, and emergency response. Trainees can practice procedures in a virtual environment, with natural language AI providing instructions, explanations, or feedback, and visual generative ML potentially customizing scenarios to adapt to each user's learning curve.
\subsection{Remote teleconferencing}
In situations where face-to-face communication is not feasible, CVEs can enable remote teams to work together on shared visual tasks like planning events, brainstorming ideas, or reviewing documents. Natural language AI can transcribe and analyse spoken conversations, providing real-time translations or summaries, while visual generative ML can create visual aids or dynamically update shared documents. This may especially be useful in complex multinational legal and/or negotiation applications, though very clearly the risks of using assisting ML tooling increases. 
\subsection{Virtual art \& media collaboration}
Artists, animators, and multimedia professionals can collaborate in CVEs to create and develop their projects, such as films, animations, or video games. Natural language AI can help in storyboarding, scriptwriting, or character development, while visual generative ML can generate new visuals or adapt existing assets based on user input and style preferences.
\subsection{Data visualization and analysis}
Small teams working with large datasets can use CVEs to visually explore and analyze data in a more intuitive and engaging way. Natural language AI can help users query and interact with the data using conversational interfaces, while visual generative ML can generate new visualizations based on patterns and trends identified in the data.
\subsection{Education and virtual classrooms}
    Educators can leverage CVEs to create immersive learning experiences that engage students in collaborative activities, such as group projects, problem-solving, or scientific experiments. Natural language AI can facilitate communication, provide personalized tutoring, or assess student progress, while visual generative ML can create customized educational content based on individual needs and interests.
\subsection{Virtual labs and scientific research}
Researchers can use CVEs to conduct experiments, visualize complex data, or simulate real-world conditions in a controlled environment. Natural language AI can assist in interpreting results, automating lab protocols, or identifying research gaps, while visual generative ML can generate predictions or models based on existing data to support hypothesis testing and decision-making.

\subsection{Biomedical}
Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) have immense potential in the fields of chemical and medical molecular modeling. By incorporating natural language AI and visual generative machine learning, these environments can revolutionize the way scientists and researchers approach complex chemical and biological problems. Here are some specific use cases:

    Drug design and discovery:
    CVEs can enable researchers to collaboratively visualize and manipulate 3D molecular structures in real-time, identifying potential drug candidates and understanding protein-ligand interactions. Natural language AI can help users interact with the molecular data, while visual generative ML can predict potential binding sites, energetics, or toxicity profiles based on existing knowledge.

    Protein structure prediction and modeling:
    Small teams can work together to predict protein structures, visualize folding patterns, and model protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions. Natural language AI can assist in annotating and explaining the structural features, while visual generative ML can generate new structural hypotheses based on sequence alignments, homology modeling, and experimental data.

    Molecular dynamics simulations:
    CVEs can facilitate collaboration on complex molecular dynamics simulations, allowing researchers to analyze and visualize trajectories, energetics, and conformational changes. Natural language AI can help users navigate through simulation data and identify relevant patterns, while visual generative ML can create new conformations or predict the effects of mutations on protein stability and function.

    Cheminformatics and QSAR modeling:
    Researchers can leverage CVEs to develop and validate Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, which predict the biological activity of chemical compounds based on their structural properties. Natural language AI can facilitate the exploration and interpretation of chemical descriptors, while visual generative ML can suggest new compounds with desired properties or optimize existing molecular scaffolds.

    Metabolic pathway modeling:
    Small teams can work together to build and analyze metabolic pathways, integrating experimental data and computational models to understand the underlying mechanisms and predict metabolic fluxes. Natural language AI can assist in annotating and explaining pathway components, while visual generative ML can generate new pathway hypotheses or predict the effects of genetic or environmental perturbations.

    Biomolecular visualization and virtual reality:
    CVEs can offer immersive, interactive experiences for exploring biomolecular structures and dynamics, enhancing researchers' understanding of complex biological systems. Natural language AI can provide contextual information or guide users through molecular landscapes, while visual generative ML can create new visualizations or adapt existing ones based on user preferences and insights.

    Collaborative molecular docking and virtual screening:
    Small teams can use CVEs to perform collaborative molecular docking and virtual screening, which involve predicting the binding of small molecules to target proteins. Natural language AI can help users refine docking parameters and analyze results, while visual generative ML can generate alternative poses or suggest new compounds for screening based on user feedback and existing data.
