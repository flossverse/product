              \begin{itemize}
              \item
                This is absolutely the most important one.\\
                Here I clearly describe the subject, without complex
                jargon or words.\\
                Keep this short, concise, and direct to your subject
              \item
                Instead of creating a very long phrase, break this into
                2.\\
                The first line is the key one, and in the second one you
                can reiterate making the subject stand even more
              \item
                Every subject requires specific words, use your
                imagination and go wild.\\
                It won't hurt using interesting words, but avoid adding
                1000 of them. It won't make the image any better
                (actually will mess up with your prompt
              \item
                In the last section, I keep the aspect ratio,
                resolution, quality, stylized, and so on. You can add
                these in the beginning but I prefer to keep my structure
                very simple and clean\\
                You see, you don't need much more. Literally 3/4
                sections.

          The team has developed a new algorithm for re-aging faces in a
          single image. The algorithm works by first detecting the face
          in the image and then using a neural network to generate a new
          face with a different age. The algorithm can be used in a
          variety of applications including visual effects, video
          conferencing, and photo editing. The algorithm was trained
          using over 50,000 images of faces from a variety of sources

          The Text2Room algorithm generates 3D meshes from a given text
          prompt by synthesizing a sequence of images from different
          poses. The core idea is to select viewpoints such that the
          content of each image can be fused into a seamless, textured
          3D mesh. The algorithm iteratively fuses scene frames with the
          existing geometry to create a seamless mesh. Unlike existing
          works that focus on generating single objects or zoom-out
          trajectories from text, our method generates complete 3D
          scenes with multiple objects and explicit 3D geometry.

          They first demonstrate that paraphrasing attacks can break a
          range of detectors, including those using watermarking schemes
          and neural network-based detectors. They then provide a
          theoretical impossibility result showing that for a
          sufficiently good language model, even the best-possible
          detector can only perform marginally better than a random
          classifier. Finally, they show that even LLMs protected by
          watermarking schemes can be vulnerable to spoofing attacks
          where adversarial humans can add hidden watermarking
          signatures to their generated text.

        The article discusses how the internet has ruined the Metaverse,
        and how it can still be saved. It argues that the internet has
        made the Metaverse less accessible and has made it more
        difficult to find information. However, it also states that the
        Metaverse can still be saved if people are willing to work
        together to make it more accessible and user-friendly.

        The Metaverse, a.k.a. the Internet 3.0, is the next stage of the
        Internet. It will be a decentralized digital world with its own
        currency, called MetaCurrency. It will be a place where people
        can sign contracts, make purchases, and interact with others
        without the need for a third party. Metaverse is a Chinese
        blockchain platform that is trying to build a decentralized
        digital world. It is designed to be a place where people can

        shared rights \& permissions Souls can be used as a natural way
        for artists to stake their reputation on their works. When
        issuing an NFT, an artist can issue it from their Soul. pastry
        By viewing the SBTs in an artist s Soul, buyers can confirm the
        Soul belongs to the artist, thereby confirming the NFTs
        legitimacy. Additionally, artists could issue an SBT in their
        Soul that attests to the NFT s membership to a collection \&
        vouches for its scarcity. Souls would thus create a verifiable,
        on-chain way to stake and build reputation on the provenance and
        scarcity of an object. This can go beyond art. Souls can be used
        for services, rentals, and any market built on scarcity,
        reputation, or authenticity. There is no method for establishing
        reputation for web3 identities. SBTs that represent education
        credentials, work history, previous loans, and rental contracts
        could serve as a persistent record of credit relevant history.
        So far, web3 has largely relied on token sales or airdrops to
        summon new communities. SBTs offer a radical improvement called
        souldrops . Using SBTs, a DAO that wants to form a community
        within a specific L1 can souldrop to devs who hold 3/5
        conference attendance SBTs, or other tokens reflecting
        attendance like POAPs.
