Artist keywords that are known to work\par \textbf{Structure tips TL;DR}

    
      
        This is absolutely the most important one. \newline
Here I clearly describe the subject, without complex jargon or words. \newline
Keep this short, concise, and direct to your subject
      \\

    
  
    
      
        Instead of creating a very long phrase, break this into 2. \newline
The first line is the key one, and in the second one you can reiterate making the subject stand even more
      \\

    
  
    
      
        Every subject requires specific words, use your imagination and go wild. \newline
It won't hurt using interesting words, but avoid adding 1000 of them. It won't make the image any better (actually will mess up with your prompt
      \\

    
  
    
      
        In the last section, I keep the aspect ratio, resolution, quality, stylized, and so on. You can add these in the beginning but I prefer to keep my structure very simple and clean \newline
You see, you don't need much more. Literally 3/4 sections.

With the help of generative AI it may be possible to democratise the externalisation of complex narratives, with these new narratives shaping the outcomes of society through the medium of the metaverse

A lot of metaverse recently has just been convergence as companies take their existing simulation and repackage it for the moment.\subsubsection{Games is the main convergence: from globalblock ""More companies are entering the metaverse as global electronics giant Sony has announced their own metaverse push in the latest annual corporate strategy meeting. Sony said this will be a more focused approach, as they aim to use metaverse-inspired experiences to engage users. As Sony owns PlayStation Brands, one of the biggest install userbases in the world, they are in an amazing position to make an impact. They have also revealed that prior investments in Epic, makers of the Fortnite game, and Bungie, another gaming studio, are part of this push."}

Souls can be used as a natural way for artists to stake their reputation on their works.
When issuing an NFT, an artist can issue it from their Soul.
pastry
By viewing the SBTs in an artist’s Soul, buyers can confirm the Soul belongs to the artist, thereby confirming the NFTs legitimacy.
Additionally, artists could issue an SBT in their Soul that attests to the NFT’s membership to a collection \& vouches for its scarcity.
Souls would thus create a verifiable, on-chain way to stake and build reputation on the provenance and scarcity of an object.
This can go beyond art. Souls can be used for services, rentals, and any market built on scarcity, reputation, or authenticity.
There is no method for establishing reputation for web3 identities.
SBTs that represent education credentials, work history, previous loans, and rental contracts could serve as a persistent record of credit relevant history.
𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐨𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐜 𝐛𝐞𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐨𝐫
So far, web3 has largely relied on token sales or airdrops to summon new communities.
SBTs offer a radical improvement called “souldrops”.
Using SBTs, a DAO that wants to form a community within a specific L1 can souldrop to devs who hold 3/5 conference attendance SBTs, or other tokens reflecting attendance like POAPs.\subsection{Usability}
