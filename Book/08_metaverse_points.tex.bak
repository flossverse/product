Metaverse is coming, in some form, at some point
It's not currently very clear what it is, or if people want it anyway
From a business perspective metaverse is the worst of the remote collaboration toolkits, and undermines productivity
It's probably technology for technologies sake to a degree, but the time feels right for the attempt
Industry has noted the risk, and failure of Meta in this domain and have latched onto "open metaverse" as a narrative to derisk their interest
Trust, governance, and safeguarding, are far harder in these realtime distributed social systems
There's a bunch of startups and options, and there's interesting work and some adoption but scaling is very hard in the face of tepid consumer interest
There seems to be genuine and undeniable interest in digital scarcity. The ownership of digital goods seems natural to younger digitally native users
This is serviced already by various (gaming) platforms, but they are all isolated ecosystems
Uniting these with portable "goods" across the digital universe (metaverse) likely requires a global digital ledger (blockchain)
Crypto is igniting imagination on this topic, and is seeing adoption both inside out outside of the metaverse contexts
Crypto is a nightmare, rife with scams, poor technology choices, limited life, and incorrect assumptions
There do seem to be better options emerging
