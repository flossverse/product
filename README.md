# Metaverse

Money in Metaverses
Bitcoin and stablecoins in  social XR
a draft product roadmap

## Purpose

The Metaverse repository was created to explore ways that small and medium sized enterprises could benefit from secure economic activity within global metaverse applications. It is not a turnkey solution but rather a collection of literature, free and open-source software, and best practice. It is designed to inform a curious company using a [single book format resource](https://github.com/flossverse/product/blob/main/Book/metaverseBTC.pdf), and a [how-to guide](https://github.com/flossverse/origin/tree/main/Lab).
